<h2>&#x2022;  Overview</h2>
<p> Floods are the most destructive form of natural hazards in both 
    local and global context.This is true in terms of both loss of 
    life and property damage. Early flood forecasting can
    be used to identify potential areas of flooding in order to develop
    mitigatory planning and evacuation programs to remove people from 
    such areas during flooding and also to implement suitable preventive 
    measures to avoid damage to properties.<br>
    In this project, our main objective is to build a flood forecasting 
    system for Mi Oya river basin(Sri Lanka).Mi Oya Basin is heavily 
    affected by seasonal flooding and droughts.

<p> As per the available data, floods in the Mi Oya basin are unleashed 
    due to river overflow and reservoir spilling. Out of the several 
    reservoirs located in the basin, Tabbowa and Inginimitiya are crucial 
    in worsening the flood impacts as these two reservoirs are
    frequently spilling under adverse weather conditions. As such, the 
    prevalence of a real-time flood forecasting model with the incorporation 
    of the reservoir operations for the entire basin is essential to 
    alleviate the flood induced impacts while preserving the optimum volume
    of water in the major reservoirs in the basin.
